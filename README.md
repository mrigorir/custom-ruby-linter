# Cpastone Project - Custom Ruby Linter

This was a really chanllenging capstone to be honest. But it worth it! write code in order to check code's proper indentation, elegance, order and help to acomplish the best practices to keep projects clean, has been very excited and tricky, but in the end I've managed to develope some of the most basic linter methods by watching rubocop's corrections. 


# The Build

The custom Ruby linter currently checks/detects for:

- Missing/unexpected tags such as parenthesis (), brakets [] and curly brackets {}
- Trailing spaces
- Empty line error
- Missing/unexpected end
- Wrong indentation

> The following are images indicating good and bard way to code, in acordance to the mentioned methods:

## Missing/Unexpected Tag
~~~ruby

# good

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end

# bad

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b     <- # Missing parenthesis here
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end
~~~

## Trailing spaces
> Note the pipe "|" location to indicate the extra whitespace
~~~ruby

# good

class Canvas|
  def parameters(a, b)|
    @a = a|
    @b = b|
  end|
end|

# bad

class Canvas |
  def parameters(a, b)      |
    @a = a|
    @b = b|
  end|
end
~~~

## Empty line
~~~ruby

# good

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end

# bad

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
                                       # <- empty line
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end
~~~

## Unexpected end
~~~ruby

# good

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end

# bad

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end
end    # <- unexpected end   
~~~

## Indentation Check
~~~ruby

# good

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
    @a = a
    @b = b
  end
end

# bad

module Canvas 
  def parameters(a, b)
        @a = a
            @b = b
  end
end
~~~

## Built With
- Ruby
- RSpec for Ruby Testing


# Getting Started

Get a local copy from my repository using this command:

```
$ cd <folder>
```

Once you are on the directory you want to set the project, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrigorir/custom-ruby-linter
```

**To use the tester file, for checking any errors** 

~~~bash
$ bin/ruby main.rb
~~~

## Testing the tool

> Install rspec for test porpuses and colorize (optional) so the errors have a better look.

~~~bash
$ gem install rspec 
~~~

~~~bash
$ gem install colorize 
~~~

In your terminal, run `rspec` from root of the folder.

To take into account: tester.rb file has been excluded from rubocop's corrections, since this file contains on-porpuse errors in order to test this tool.
